//packages installed :
EXPRESS, Dotenv, http-status-codes, nodemon, winston, 
sequalize, mysql2(driver for sequalize),sequelize-cli

note -
1. sequelize-cli -> initiates sequelize project, should be declared in the 
folder where all source code is present (in here src)
inside src -> npx sequelize init
It creates a models, migrations, seeders folder inside src and indide config folder config.json

Setup : npm init -> Installing packages

node --watch : automatically restarts application when files are changed
or nodeman

 npx nodemon src/index.js -> cmd starts nodemon

 npx -> node package execute / executes npm




# Routes :

 1.api based routes
 app.get('/api/v1/blogs', ()=>{

 });

 2. Non api based routes
 app.get('/home');


 # ORM 
 Layer that connects Object Oriented Programming to relational data bases.
 eg. Mangoose, Sequilize

#Pushing code into git
Create a new git repo manually
then copy the http git status code

then in cmd
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "commit msg"
3. git remote add origin hhtp_status_code
 git remote add origin https://github.com/ripper06/Base-Node-Project-Template.git
 4.  git push origin main/master


 //sequalize

 1. Creating database
 cmd - npx sequelize db:create
Loaded configuration file "config\config.json"
creates the database

2. Create table inside database
cmd - npx sequelize model:generate --name Airplane --attributes modelNumber:string,capacity:integer
DOESN'T creates a table with table name with its attributes.
Only create 2 folders one in model 
and another in migrations.

Actual creation will happen after 
we commit the pending migrations to db, done by
cmd - npx sequelize db:migrate

js level constraints put in models folder eg. airplane.js
database level constraints put in migrations

npx sequelize db:seed --seed <seed_file_name>
add the seed content of that perticular file into database

So chane both migration and models to change both at javascript level and database level.

express can't read/parse req.body....so we have to make changes to make it parse in the json format
app.use(express.json());

3.  npx sequelize seed:generate --name add-airplanes --> to create seeder files 
    npx sequelize db:seed:all --> commits all seder files data into database

    //Implement update airplane api
